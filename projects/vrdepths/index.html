<h1>Game Progress</h1>

<p>
</p>

<p>For this game, I came up with the following lighting goals:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Objects that look convincing at any depth</li>
  <li>Performant shaders</li>
  <li>Artistic controls to tweak how things look</li>
</ul>

<p>At first, I tried to combine different effects as needed. Objects looked bluer the deeper they were, had a fresnel also based on depth, and there was an ocean skybox with colors based on "depth regions" that I manually set. This gave me artistic control and let me prototype new things quickly. However, anytime I changed something, I had to test it at all depths and make many more adjustments.
</p>

<h1>Light Color Transmittance Through Water</h1>

<p>Eventually, I decided that the most important part of lighting underwater scenes was simulating how light color changes as it travelled through water. This effect happens because colors of different wavelengths are absorbed at different rates. Red is absorbed fastest, followed by orange, yellow, green, and blue.
</p>

<p>This can be modeled by applying exponential decay to the RGB channels based on the distance light travels in water. This became the defining formula, which all lighting effects use:
</p>

<div class="indented">
    <pre>
<code class="language-c" >// HLSL:
inline half3 GetColorTransmittance(float travelDistance)
{
    return exp(travelDistance * float3(-0.0033558, -0.002562, -0.0020622));
}</code>
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"></div>
<p>Below is the terrain mesh with it applied. The beach at the top gets full lighting, while the depths are essentially pitch black.

<h1>Ocean Gradient Skybox</h1>

<p>I added a 3-point gradient skybox based on the player's depth. The upper and lightest color is blended using a power function based on the depth. As players go deeper, players can still look up and see sunlight, but it becomes a smaller circle.
</p>

<p>The 3 colors of the gradient are sampled using the light transmission equation at depths relative to the player. This fixed problems I had earlier, where the skybox and scene felt like it had different light sources.
</p>

<p>After verifying that the skybox matched the scene at all depths, I added a subtle color filter to the skybox, making it brighter and greener. The green simulates plankton in the water, which reflect greenish light. The added brightness was somewhat unrealistic, but I kept it because it made objects and creatures appear more dark and ominous in comparison.
</p>

    </div>

<p>The fog color uses the gradient skybox formula, letting objects fade smoothly into the murky water. Exponential fog looked best, but for better performance, I wanted a maximum view distance to set the camera far plane to, so I modified the fog intensity formula to:

</div>

<p>Fresnel is technically a reflection at grazing angles, and so I sampled the ocean gradient once again, this time using the surface normal as the direction. This makes the fresnel matches the surrounding ocean at any depth.
