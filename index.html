          <p>I enjoy finding ways to apply mathematics and programming to real-world problems. There's nothing better than finding creative-technical ways to model something. Most of my work is in game development, medical research, and machine learning.</p>
          <p>When I'm not programming, I like to compose music, play volleyball, write stories/music, go on outdoor adventures like skydiving, and volunteer.</p>
          <p>This is a collection of my favorite programming and math projects, as well as some experiments in 3D art and music composition.</p>
          <p>Enjoy!</p>

              <p>During my year-long internship at Moffitt Cancer Center, I was lucky to be working in the Bioinformatics Core on one of their new research programs, MONA. MONA was originally conceived for the purpose of finding new interactions between genes and metabolites associated with lung cancer, but the flexible approach lends it toward anything involving genes, metabolites, proteins, micro RNA, etc.</p>
              <p>Aside from its network-based approach for integrative data analysis, it has a customizable feature for using weighted correlations to add speculative interactions between expressors (genes and metabolites) which aren't currently annotated.</p>
              <p>The end goal is to give researchers a way to identify likely interactions to do further study on.</p>



              <h3 class="mb-0">Core Analysis</h3>
              <p>(describe)</p>



              <h3 class="mb-0">Interactive Network Visualization</h3>
              <p>For the data visualization, I used the statistics-focused R language. R was a natural choice because of how easily it could handle structured data and the availability of the Shiny framework. RShiny is useful for quickly creating interactive web applications that incorporate R functionality.</p>
              <p>I experimented with several different visualization packages before settling on the visNetwork package. Since it created graphs that updated in real-time and could be pulled around by the user, it was a natural choice for large-scale data, and fun to use.</p>
              <p>MONA incorporates a network-based approach for integrative data analysis, using empirical correlations to make edges with expressors that aren’t previously annotated.</p>



              <h3 class="mb-0">FUTURE PLANS:</h3>
              <p>While my internship has officially ended in December 2017, I am continuing work on MONA as a developer and contributor to the upcoming paper. My current work is a mix of adding features and testing MONA with different cancer research experiment data.</p>
              <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This project is property of Moffitt Cancer Center and is currently unpublished. I'll update this after publication and add the link to the paper!</p>

              <p>I often have ideas for ways to apply genetic algorithms, but usually end up not implementing them due to the time required to get them working. GAB-Class is designed to make it as fast as possible to get genetic algorithms working in C++.</p>
              <p>The project includes a GeneticAlgorithm class which holds the data and runs each generation, a Chromosome abstract class that provides common methods, and two static libraries for crossover and mutation methods.</p>
              <p>With this setup, it only takes roughly 15 minutes to create a new genetic algorithm and get started writing the fitness function.</p>

              <!--<div class="subheading mb-3">Shout! Media Productions</div>-->
              <p>One of the most popular animation techniques for hobbyist game devs is using keyframed animations to block out every action. In the figure below, the dots on the left represent bone rotations at certain times during a looping jog animation. These are called keyframes.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid img-profile mx-auto mb-2" src="img/procAnim1/keyframes1.jpg" alt="">
              <p>Keyframed animations offer great control over specific poses during actions. In a run cycle, it is easy to define the reaching/passing points. However, it tends to create stiff animations where the actor looks like they are moving to the beat of a metronome.</p>
              <p>Adding intermediate keyframes and shifting the timing of keyframes can help mitigate this, but it is a time-consuming process and makes it difficult to modify the animations later. I often found myself tweaking part of an animation to make it smoother, only to find that it ruined the animation 6 frames later.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-0">What is Amblyopia?</h3>
              <p>Ambylopia is an eye problem where a person has a weakened eye. In many cases, the person favors their strongest eye, and the weak eye can begin to wander. This is commonly known as having a "lazy eye."</p>
              <p>According to Lazyeyegames.com, almost 3% of people have this problem. One of my family members has it, and I decided to recreate her favorite word search game with a color-scheme designed to help her eye if she used red-blue glasses while playing it.</p>
              <p>According to my main reference, Lazyeyegames.com, amblyopia involves the brain ignoring a certain amount of input from the weak eye. In order to improve, the brain must be forced to use both eyes simultaneously. This point affected the game design and steered me away from making a game that simply "exercised" the weak eye, and toward a game design that required the player to use both eyes at the same time.</p>
              <p>To accomplish this, I decided to create a handful of minigames using the idea behind a popular word search game. Being a game where the player searches for words among random letters, the players’ eyes must be watching many things simultaneously and looking for patterns.</p>
              
              <h3 class="mb-0">How is the game set up to use both eyes?</h3>
              <p>The player wears red-blue glasses. The game colors are tweaked so that the red aligns with the red lens and the blue with the blue lens. When letters in these colors are drawn on a black screen, the player sees a different image in each eye. The game is set up so that letters are randomly assigned to be blue or red.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid img-profile mx-auto mb-2" src="img/wordSearch/layout.jpg" alt="">
              <p>Through experimentation, I found that viewing other colors through the glasses was disorienting and stressful. This was due to the colors looking very different in each eye, and being able to see both colors simultaneously. However, yellow and purple were fairly neutral, so I used those to convey information to the player quickly.</p>
              <p>For example, the score was shown in a neutral color so that the player could quickly glance at it before returning to the red/blue letters. Also, the amount of time left each round was indicated by a large box that shrank in size. Giving it a neutral color and a basic shape made it easier to see in peripheral vision.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-0">Implementation</h3>
              <p>To handle so many words in a quick manner, I loaded 235,886 words into a dictionary. Since the data did not include plurals, the game automatically assumes that valid words with an “S” at the end are also valid. Furthermore, if a word is rejected, the player can press a key to have it added to a secondary dictionary of custom words.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-0">Game modes</h3>
              <p>I added 8 game modes total. Here is a sampling:</p>
              <br>
              <img class="img-fluid img-profile mx-auto mb-2" src="img/wordSearch/explore.jpg" alt="">
              <br><br>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">EXPLORATION:</div>
              <p>The player starts with only the word "CAT" on the top left. Typing a word causes all the letters next to that word to be discovered. The goal is to uncover the entire grid before time runs out.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid img-profile mx-auto mb-2" src="img/wordSearch/lava.jpg" alt="">
              <br><br>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">LAVA ESCAPE:</div>
              <p>Letters sink into lava, according to how “heavy” they are. Typing words adds new random letters around those words, but also increases the weight. The player attempts to stay above the lava for as long as possible.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid img-profile mx-auto mb-2" src="img/wordSearch/zombies.jpg" alt="">
              <br><br>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">ZOMBIES:</div>
              <p>Typing a word holds the zombies at bay, but if no word is typed within a couple seconds, the zombies are given 1 turn to spread. Eventually, they take over the entire grid.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid img-profile mx-auto mb-2" src="img/wordSearch/wolves.jpg" alt="">
              <br><br>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">WOLVES:</div>
              <p>This mode increases the grid size, shrinks the letters, and adds random blank spaces. To increase the tension, there is a sound loop of wolves howling, so that players can feel like they're about to be eaten if they don't find enough words.</p>
              <br>


              <h3 class="mb-0">Making it fun and responsive!</h3>
              <p>It is difficult for people with amblyopia to use their eyes together and sometimes they will get headaches while doing so. To make the game less stressful, I included settings for letter size and the speed of the game so players could adjust the game to their comfort level.</p>
              <p>I also wanted to make the game as enjoyable as possible, so people would do their therapy regularly. This was fairly challenging because I couldn't use techniques like screenshake and particle bursts. The visuals needed to be simple and extremely clear at all times. In the end, I decided to add these features:</p>
              <lu>
                <li>Letters briefly expand when selected, with a satisfying sound</li>
                <li>Successfully finding a word triggers a happy coin sound</li>
                <li>Cheesy announcers congratulate the player when they find large words (these audio clips were from a package purchased on the Unity Asset Store)</li>
                <li>The game keeps record of the top 10 high scores in all game modes, as well as the total number of words found</li>
              </lu>

              <br>
              <h3 class="mb-0">Conclusion</h3>
              <p>It was an amazing experience being able to work on this project. Technology can be a powerful new tool for dealing with medical conditions and games can offer a way to make it a more fun and enjoyable experience.</p>
              <p><strong>FUTURE PLANS:</strong> I'm in contact with the USF professor who oversaw the project for getting medical approval. I don't think it will happen soon, but it would be nice as there aren't many games out there for Amblyopia. (Maybe because of the medical approval?)</p>

              <h3 class="mb-0">Project Description</h3>
              <p>This project served as my senior project while getting a math degree. I only knew VB6 at the time and decided to use VBA in Excel. I had it output the music to an Excel sheet mimicing a piano roll, which I would then play on my MIDI keyboard.</p>
              <p>That took a very long time (I play guitar, not piano), so for most of the development, I wasn't able to actually hear the music.</p>


              <h3 class="mb-0">Preparation Phase</h3>
              <p>The program started by generating a pseudo-random chord progression in C Major. This didn't have a direct effect on the notes, but influenced the fitness function.</p>
              <p>The 2nd preparation phase was deciding where notes would occur for each instrument. I wrote a GA for this</p>
              <p>I separated these phases from the main GA because it would let my laptop not die when performing calculations, and it allowed me to keep the same chord progressions and note locations across several iterations of the GA. This gave me a clearer picture of how the GA was developing.</p>
              <p>This is why some of the samples have such a similar sound - they were evolving based on the same chord progressions and/or note locations.</p>



              <h3 class="mb-0">Evolving the Notes</h3>
              <p>This was the most important and processor-heavy part of the project. The GA started by filling in the previously-assigned note locations with completely random pitches in the ranges of each instrument. It then created 99 copies so there were 100 total quartet passages, or "chromosomes" (in GA terms).</p>



              <h3 class="mb-0">Selection Phase</h3>
              <p>Each generation, the chromosomes were scored according to a fitness function meant to reflect how "good" they should sound.</p>
              <p>Research has shown that popular songs tend to flow the way the brain expects them to, but also have a small, important level of unexpectedness. I used that principle by recording how much variance there was in each chromosome and combining that with a score of how well it fit music theory and the intended chord progression.</p>
              <p>This was done in several passes:</p>

              <p><div class="subheading mb-3"><u>NOTE LEVEL:</u></div></p>
              <p>Each note was evaluated based on how it flowed into and out of the notes around it (based on intervals), and the harmonies it created with the notes the other instruments were playing. It also accounted for the time since those other notes were started - playing notes simultaneously made their harmony score/penalty more pronounced than one note playing over other notes being held.</p>

              <p><div class="subheading mb-3"><u>MEASURE LEVEL:</u></div></p>
              <p>The notes in each measure were evaluated based on factors such as how well they represented the chord progression, and whether "unexpected" notes were in proper locations (ie. notes that would act as "leading tones" into a chord change).</p>

              <p><div class="subheading mb-3"><u>SONG LEVEL:</u></div></p>
              <p>I used statistical analysis to encourage chromosomes with interesting distributions. This helped solve a few problems. Withit this factor, chromosomes were overusing "safe" notes and sticking to the same intervals.</p>

              <p>All this was taken into account for the final score.</p>



              <h3 class="mb-0">Copy Phase</h3>
              <p>Normally there is a Crossover Phase, where low scoring chromosomes are recreated from crossed-over data from high scoring ones. I don't remember where I learned what a GA was, but I didn't know about crossovers.</p>
              <p>So I just copied the top scoring chromosome directly to all the others. It was essentially a GA set up with extreme elitism and low diversity.</p>



              <h3 class="mb-0">Mutation Phase</h3>
              <p>Each generation, all but the top scoring chromosome were mutated randomly. The mutations ranged from "take the 47th cello note and move it down 3 semitones" to "grab 6 notes and pull them up/down a measure."</p>
              <p>I found that the mutations had a huge influence on how long the GA had to run before getting a good result. For example: A melody could suddenly jump 2 octaves higher, stay there for a few notes, and then return to the normal range. This is obviously bad, but anytime a single note would randomly move downward, it would make the chromosome even worse. This is why I used so many types of mutations - including ones that would move entire sections of neighboring notes.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-0">First Results</h3>
              <p>Things started out pretty randomly... The algorithm had a long ways to go.</p>

              <br>
              <br>
              <p>After improving the algorithm, this flighty tune appeared, before quickly descending into madness.</p>
              <iframe width="100%" height="100" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/197511575&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>Eventually, the music started sounding like... something you would call 'music'.</p>
              <iframe width="100%" height="100" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/197511622&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
              <br>
              <br>
              <h3 class="mb-0">Best Result</h3>
              <p>Finally, I got a piece that had some interesting melodies and countermelodies! It sounds like it really wants to build up to something great - before getting slightly confused.</p>
              <iframe width="100%" height="100" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/197511647&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <h3 class="mb-0">FUTURE PLANS</h3>
              <p>I plan to translate the project to C# and take advantage of having a faster PC than I did back in 2012, as well as my increased knowledge of genetic algorithms. The obvious improvement is to incorporate crossovers.</p>
              <p>I'd also like to experiment with detecting when results become stagnant, and splitting the GA population for a set number of generations. Elite individuals will apply simulated annealing in an attempt to converge on a better solution while non-elite (I like to call them "volatile") individuals have an increased mutation rate and switch to using rank selection.</p>
              <p>(Non-GA translation) This would give the best individuals a chance to further prove themselves, while giving other solutions a chance. At least, it would be fun to try!</p>
